# About This Site

This site was created by me (but I'd love to have your [pull
requests](https://github.com/bstank/bstank.github.io)) in order to provide a
resource for myself and others on glibc heap exploits. I'm not looking to just
create a tutorial here, but something that provides useful examples and
explanations, and helps with the intuition for developing memory corruption
exploits. I compiled all of the examples on Arch GNU+Linux with GCC, so let me
know if the build files don't work for you. All of the libcs come from various
Ubuntu releases.
